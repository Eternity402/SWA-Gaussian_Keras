> Just to get some basic concepts of the SWA-Gaussian, I brought a simple model from keras tutorial, and changed it a little bit.

> CIFAR100 dataset is used to test the performance of SWAG.
> Also you can compare with SWA.


# SWAG Keras_application.py
> It contains all of the code.  
> This is just an application of the alogrithm below:
